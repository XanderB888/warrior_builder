We will be building a program that generates a random message each time the user runs the program.

We will build the entire project on my local computer by using the following programs:
 - VSCode for JavaScript
 - Git version Control
 - Command line

After the program has been written on the local computer we will upload it to Git Hub using Git.

Steps:

1.Come up with a topic: *Completed*

"Which Warrior are you?"

- You are a "different warriors".
- Your special power is "special powers".
- You became a warrior: "reason for becoming a warrior"
- You fight for the "kingdom" Kingdom.

2.Create your JavaScript file and run some code to test it: *Completed*

3.Store message components: *Completed*

-We will use arrays to store our 4 different components.

4. Create the message: *Completed*

-We will use a loop to do this with a switch to iterate through all 4 components


5.Put the program together: *Completed*

-Combining the different parts of the program so that the messages are randomly selected every time the program runs.

6.Upload files to GitHub: *Completed*
